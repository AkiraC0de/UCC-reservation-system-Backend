# UCC Reservation System - Backend

This is the backend server for my first-year school project, **UCC Reservation System**. The system handles reservation functionalities for a university campus context and implements all HTTP methods (CRUD operations) using a RESTful API approach.

## üöÄ Project Goal

To develop a backend system that allows users to:
- **Create** new reservations
- **Read** (fetch) existing reservations
- **Update** reservation details
- **Delete** reservations
- Handle full HTTP method operations (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE)

This backend is a part of a full-stack web application and is my first attempt at building a REST API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- **Node.js** ‚Äì JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** ‚Äì Web application framework
- **MongoDB** ‚Äì NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** ‚Äì MongoDB object modeling for Node.js

## üß† What I‚Äôm Learning
- How to structure a backend project
- Managing routes, controllers, and models
- Connecting and interacting with MongoDB
- Using environment variables for secure development
- RESTful API design
